## Overview

FutureCraft is an innovative learning platform designed to empower users with cutting-edge courses in various futuristic technologies. The platform focuses on providing an engaging and interactive learning experience with a range of features, including a personalized dashboard, course browsing, enrollment, and a responsive design for accessibility on various devices.

## Goals

- To create an intuitive and welcoming homepage that clearly guides users to all main areas of the platform.
- To implement a secure user registration and login system.
- To design a user-friendly dashboard for tracking learning progress and course enrollment.
- To offer a comprehensive course catalog with an efficient enrollment process.
- To develop an interactive learning module interface with multimedia content and practical tasks.
- To incorporate a progress tracking system with visual indicators like charts and progress bars.
- To establish a feedback and support system for continuous improvement and user assistance.
- To ensure the platform is responsive and accessible on a wide range of devices.

## Scope and Context

The MVP will focus on the core functionalities required to launch the platform, ensuring a robust foundation for future enhancements. It will cater to a diverse audience, prioritizing ease of use and accessibility. The project will be developed using React.js, leveraging Node.js for backend operations.

## System Design

- **Front-End:** React.js for building the user interface, with a focus on reusable components.
- **Back-End:** Node.js with Express.js for handling server-side logic and API requests.
- **Database:** MongoDB for storing user data, course information, and progress tracking.
- **Authentication:** Implement JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for secure user authentication.
- **APIs:** RESTful API design for efficient communication between the front-end and back-end.
- **Responsive Design:** Utilize CSS frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI for a responsive layout.

## Alternatives Considered

- Vue.js and Angular were considered as alternatives to React.js, but React was chosen for its component-based architecture and large community support.
- For the back-end, Python with Django was an option, but Node.js was preferred for its performance benefits and seamless integration with the front-end.
